# Portal

This portal connects you to freely available educational games. It grew out of a need to find (and create my own) educational games for my kids. While there is no "Kongregate" style portal listing games (most of them seem to be paid products), I decided to create a collection of whatever's freely available.

Educational gaming is right now (circa 2015) a newly re-emerging industry. For more information, check out these awesome classes from MIT (edX):

- [Introduction to Game Design](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-game-design-mitx-11-126x): the fundamentals of creating solid, fun games. Necessary to make non-boring educational games.
- [Design and Development of Games for Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/design-development-games-learning-mitx-11-127x): building on the concepts of the above course, an overview of what education in games means and how to create awesome educational games.
- [Implementation and Evaluation of Educational Technology](https://www.edx.org/course/implementation-evaluation-educational-mitx-11-133x): how to best integrate educational technology into your class or learning environment.
