# Portal

This portal connects you to freely available educational games. It grew out of a need to find (and create my own) educational games for my kids. While there is no "Kongregate" style portal listing games (most of them seem to be paid products), I decided to create a collection of whatever's freely available.

# Using this Site

Browse the list of games below based on age. If you're interested in knowing the educational value, check out the links to the educator's guides for each game (if available).

Educational gaming is right now (circa 2015) a newly re-emerging industry. The industry now knows that games can develop and evaluate sound, 21st-century skills (sometimes things that are difficult or impossible to teach in classic education).
